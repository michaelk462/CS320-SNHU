## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Best practices like code reviews and following secure coding standards are my ways of ensuring software is functional and secure. Security is also maintained by giving it the latest updates all the time if it is dependent on other modules or libraries. Even though it is not enough for the software to be functional and secure, I also document it and keep communication with the stakeholders so that they can see these different aspects being realized throughout the development process.
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs might be changed into a program through the process of first listening carefully to their requirements and then asking them questions for clarification in order to get a better understanding of their expectations. After figuring out those needs, I convert them into the exact features and operations of the program, and I always consider the ease of use and the accessibility. User feedback is significant in fine-tuning the program so that it meets their objectives and addresses all problems. Such a cooperative method, besides making the quality of the final product better, also helps to boost customer satisfaction.
## How do I approach designing software?
To design software, I first dig deep into the project requirements to figure out not only the technical limitations but also what kinds of problems in the real world the software wants to solve. After that, I draw up a system architecture plan with the help of diagrams and I also list out the main components, making sure that the system is sustainable. While working on the design, I dedicate my efforts to creating a simple-to-use interface and, more importantly, I get the stakeholders’ feedback to adjust the design accordingly. I also implement careful planning and continuous iterations based on the feedback from users and the team to make software that is strong and, at the same time, custom-made to meet the set goals.
